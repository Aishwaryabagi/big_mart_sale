Big Mart Sales Prediction

Predict product sales for Big Mart outlets using machine learning and interactively get predictions through a Flask web app.

Project Overview

This project builds an XGBoost regression model to predict sales for different products in Big Mart stores based on historical data.
It includes a Flask web interface where users can input product and outlet details to get predicted sales dynamically, making it a full end-to-end ML + deployment project.
